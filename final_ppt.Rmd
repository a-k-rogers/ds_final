#Brief Introduction
.pull-left[##Research questions
* RQ1: What effect does proficienct have on the P600 ERP in response to number and gender violations while reading for L2 Spanish learners?
* RQ2: Can ERPs be used to fit a linear model of proficiency?
]
.pull-right[##Hypothesis:
I predict that higher proficiency learners will have higher mean P600 amplitudes inside the 400-900ms time window. Furthermore, while it is not typically done with ERP data, I predict that a linear model demonstrating the relationship between learner proficiency and mean P600 amplitude will shed light on how learners process morphosyntax violations over the course of acquisition.

#Methods: Participants
.pull-left[
### Demographics
* 81 participants (F = 55)
* Two groups:
  * L1 English learners of Spanish (n = 57)
  * Spanish monolinguals (n = 24)
* Profiency levels
  * Advanced (n = 25)
  * Intermediate (n = 11)
  * Beginner (n = 11)
]
.pull-right[
### Criteria
* Learner participants recruited from major universities in the US
* Monolingual participans recruited from universities in Spain, Bolivia, and Paraguay
* All participants were right-handed, had normal vision, and reported no experience with additional languages

#Materials: Assessments

* Language and Social Background Questionnaire (LSBQ, Anderson et al., 2019)
* Proficiency assessments
  * MLA Cooperative Language Test (Spanish Embassy, USA)
  * Cloze test from the DELE (Educational Testing Service, Princeton, USA)
---
#Stimuli

* 120 total stimuli
* 40 per condition:
  * Grammatical (e.g. "la manzana es una fruta muy jugosa y la papaya también")
  * Number violation (e.g. "la manzana es una fruta muy jugosas y la papaya también.")
  * Gender violation (e.g. "la manzana es una fruta muy jugoso y la papaya también.")

#Procedure
.pull-left[
* Experiment conducted in two sessions
  * Session 1: Consent form, questionnaire, proficiency assessments
  * Session 2: EEG recording
* EEG recording
  * 20 trials per block, 6 total blocks
  * Stimuli presented in a randomized, counterbalanced sequence for each block
  * 5 minute break between blocks

#Statistical Analysis: EEG Data Processing
.pull-left[
### Electrodes
* EEG data collected on a 32 electrode net
* For ease of analysis, only data from the central-posterior region (CP3, CPz, CP4, P3, Pz, P4, O1, Oz, O2 electrodes) was analyzed in this project
* The central-posterior region is suitable for characterizing the P600 ERP (Alemán Bañón e al., 2018)
#### Processing
* EEG data pre-processed in the Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for EEG (HAPPE)

#Statistical Analysis: Models
In order to try something somewhat new, I elected not to do ANOVAs and t-tests, since the original paper from which I retrieved the data conducted those analyses already. For this project, I elected to run a nested model comparison of linear mixed effects models. The target variable is proficiency and the predictor variables are the grand mean amplitudes for the ROI within the 400-900 ms time window for each condition. Participant was included as a random effect. This design allows me to attempt to model the relationship between proficiency and ERP in a novel way, and to assess whether there is a difference based on condition (number vs gender violation).

#Results: ANOVA
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lmerTest)
library(lme4)
library(sjPlot)
library(sjmisc)
library(sjlabelled)
df <- read.csv(here("data_tidy", "final_tidy.csv"))
df$PARTICIPANT <- as.character(df$PARTICIPANT)
  
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

mod_null <- lmer(PROFICIENCY.TEST.SCORE ~ 1 | PARTICIPANT, data = df)
mod_pp <- lmer(PROFICIENCY.TEST.SCORE ~ 1 + mean + (1 | PARTICIPANT), data = df)
mod_fp <- lmer(PROFICIENCY.TEST.SCORE ~ 1 + mean + (1 + mean | PARTICIPANT), data = df)

anova(mod_null, mod_pp, mod_fp, test = "Chisq")
```
The anova run on the nested models helped to demonstrate that I ran the wrong kind of model, as nothing was significant. I will need to figure out what kind of model to run in place of these. I don't have repeated measures, so an lmer was not the correct type. Perhaps a simple linear model will be best. Everything that follows is based on the wrong models. Sorry.
